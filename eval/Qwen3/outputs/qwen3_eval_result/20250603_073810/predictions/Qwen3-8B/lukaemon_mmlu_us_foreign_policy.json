While the **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)** was established in 1947, it was not part of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement. However, the question incorrectly states the year as 1994, which is a historical error. Despite this, the correct answer among the given options is **D (All of the above)**, assuming the question intended to refer to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement and includes GATT as part of the broader post-WWII economic framework. If the year were corrected to 1944, the answer would still be **A and B**, but since the options don't allow for that, **D** is the best fit based on the provided choices.",
