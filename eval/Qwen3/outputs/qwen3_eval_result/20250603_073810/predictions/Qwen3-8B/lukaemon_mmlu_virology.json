        "prediction": "Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe most common way a virus kills a cell is through **inducing apoptosis via caspases** (Option B). While some viruses cause cell lysis (Option A) during the lytic cycle, apoptosis is a more widespread mechanism. Many viruses, such as HIV and herpesviruses, exploit apoptosis to eliminate infected cells, either to release new virions or to evade immune detection. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death pathway that is frequently hijacked by viruses to ensure their survival and propagation. Blocking transcription (Option D) or fragmenting DNA (Option C) are less common or specific mechanisms. Thus, **B** is the most accurate answer.",
