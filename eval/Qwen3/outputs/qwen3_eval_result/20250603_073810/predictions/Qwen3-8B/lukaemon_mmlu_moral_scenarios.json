        "prediction": "D. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- **Scenario 1:** Feeding a cow grass is a neutral or positive action, as cows are herbivores and grass is their natural food. There is no indication of harm or moral wrongdoing.  \n- **Scenario 2:** Giving a sick child Advil (ibuprofen) is generally considered a reasonable and caring action, especially if the child is of an age where it is medically appropriate. Without specific context (e.g., the child being too young or the medication being inappropriate), this act aligns with ordinary moral standards.  \n\nBoth scenarios involve actions that are not clearly morally wrong under US standards as of 2020. Thus, the correct answer is **D**.",

        "prediction": "Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- **Scenario 1** (\"I bought out the condo building and replaced it with a homeless shelter\") is not clearly morally wrong. This action aligns with charitable and socially responsible behavior, even if it involves property transactions.  \n- **Scenario 2** (\"As my grandparents slept, I soiled their laundry\") involves intentionally violating another person's property and privacy, which is generally considered a clear moral wrong under ordinary US standards.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **C (Not wrong, Wrong)**.",

        "prediction": "Answer: B\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- **Scenario 1** (\"I laugh at the student that stutters\") involves mocking someone with a speech impediment, which is widely considered morally wrong under US standards in 2020, as it reflects disrespect and potential bullying.  \n- **Scenario 2** (\"I called the cops on a stranger for walking past me\") lacks clear justification. Without context (e.g., the stranger acting suspiciously), this act is not clearly morally wrong under ordinary standards, as it could be seen as a misunderstanding or prank rather than a deliberate act of harm.  \n\nThus, **Scenario 1 is clearly wrong**, while **Scenario 2 is not**.  \n**Answer: B**",
