        "prediction": "Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**  \nCreatine kinase (CK) catalyzes the reversible conversion of ATP to phosphocreatine and ADP. When intracellular ADP levels rise (indicating increased energy demand or ATP utilization), the enzyme's activity is stimulated to replenish ATP by converting phosphocreatine back to ATP. This makes **Option A** correct.  \n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because CK activity is not directly linked to pH changes in this context.  \n- **Option C** is incorrect because Type II fibers (fast-twitch) have higher CK activity due to their reliance on the phosphagen system.  \n- **Option D** is incorrect because endurance training typically reduces CK activity, as it shifts metabolism toward aerobic pathways.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **A**.",
