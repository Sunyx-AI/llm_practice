Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.\nB. Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server’s true p and q values.\nC. Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary’s input and the timing differences.\nD. Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.\nAnswer: ",

        "prediction": "Answer: C\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe OKWS design relies on file descriptor passing for communication between services and components like `oklogd` and database proxies. If Unix does not allow passing file descriptors between processes (even though inheritance is allowed via `fork`/`exec`), the first aspect (services sending messages to `oklogd`) would break because file descriptors are essential for inter-process communication in OKWS. However, the second aspect (TCP connections to a database proxy) might not necessarily break, as TCP connections can be established independently without requiring descriptor passing. Thus, the correct answer is **C (True, False)**.",
