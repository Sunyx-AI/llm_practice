While it focused on the structure of the mind, modern **cognitive psychology** (Option C) shares a similar emphasis on internal mental processes, such as perception, memory, and problem-solving. Both approaches prioritize understanding how the mind processes information, even though structuralism relied on introspection and cognitive psychology uses experimental methods. Other options (e.g., behaviorism, psychoanalysis, humanism) focus on external behavior, unconscious processes, or holistic growth, which do not align as closely with structuralism's goals. \n\n**Answer: C**",

When data shows that very few students are meeting competencies, the immediate action is to provide **strategic or supplemental instruction** (Option B) to those who are struggling. This aligns with tiered interventions: Tier 1 (core program) is first, but if students are not meeting benchmarks, targeted support (Tier 2) is necessary. While changing the core program (A) might be a long-term solution, the question emphasizes what **must be done** immediately based on the data, which is to address the students' needs through supplemental instruction.
