While the CPI is often criticized for its fixed basket of goods and substitution bias, the GDP Deflator is considered more accurate in capturing the overall price level of the entire economy.

        "prediction": "Answer: D\n\n**Explanation:**  \nContractionary monetary policy involves actions like raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, which increase the nominal interest rate. This makes borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and consumption, thereby **decreasing aggregate demand**. A lower aggregate demand leads to **decreased output** in the short run. Additionally, reduced demand typically causes the **price level to decrease** as well. Thus, the correct sequence is:  \n**Increase (interest rate), Decrease (aggregate demand), Decrease (output), Decrease (price level)**.  \n**Answer: D**",
