        "prediction": "C\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe first hominids, such as *Sahelanthropus* and *Orrorin*, are characterized by the emergence of bipedalism, a key trait distinguishing hominids from other primates. While they may have retained some quadrupedal traits, the defining feature is bipedal locomotion. Option C (\"bipedal apes\") correctly captures this transition, as these early hominids were apes that began to walk upright. Option D (\"bipedal quadrupeds\") is contradictory, as \"bipedal\" and \"quadrupedal\" are mutually exclusive. Thus, **C** is the most accurate choice.",
