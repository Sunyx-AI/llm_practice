Answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\nQuestion: A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg.

Answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\nQuestion: A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\nAnswer: ",
        "prediction": "Answer: D. Phentolamine\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe patient's presentation is consistent with **cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications**, including **vasoconstriction, hypertension, and coronary artery spasm**. Cocaine stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to systemic vasoconstriction and increased afterload. Phentolamine, a non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker, reverses these effects by antagonizing alpha-1 receptors, thereby reducing vascular resistance and blood pressure.  \n\n**Why not the other options?**  \n- **Carvedilol/Metoprolol (A/C):** Beta-blockers are contraindicated in cocaine toxicity due to risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, worsening hypertension and myocardial ischemia.  \n- **Furosemide (B):** Not indicated here as there is no evidence of fluid overload.  \n- **Phentolamine (D):** Directly addresses cocaine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertension, making it the most appropriate choice.  \n\n**Answer: D**",

        "prediction": "Answer: B. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine  \n**Reasoning**: Codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6 to morphine, which is responsible for its analgesic effect. A deficiency in this metabolic pathway (e.g., due to genetic polymorphism) leads to poor conversion, resulting in inadequate pain relief. The family history of similar issues suggests a possible inherited CYP2D6 deficiency, making **B** the correct answer.",

Answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\nQuestion: A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?\nA. Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy\nB. Bereavement reaction\nC. Early Parkinson disease\nD. Increase in alcohol consumption\nAnswer: ",
        "prediction": "The patient presents with a worsening action tremor (not at rest) that has been present for most of her life but has become more noticeable over the past month. Key points include:  \n- **Tremor not at rest**: This rules out Parkinson's disease (which typically presents with resting tremors).  \n- **Fluoxetine use**: While SSRIs like fluoxetine are not commonly associated with tremors, they can occasionally cause extrapyramidal symptoms, especially in older adults. However, this is less likely given the patient's history.  \n- **Alcohol consumption**: The patient reports drinking one glass of wine daily to reduce tremors.
