This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\nAnswer: ",
        "prediction": "D\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe question asks for the biggest contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans. The excerpts from Calvin emphasize **predestination** (the idea that God pre-selects individuals for salvation) and the **corruption of humanity** (total depravity). However, the answer options focus on doctrinal differences.  \n\n- **Option D** correctly highlights a key theological contrast: **Lutherans retained all seven sacraments**, while **Calvinists (and other Reformed churches) recognized only two** (baptism and the Eucharist). This reflects the Calvinist emphasis on **sola scriptura** and **simplification of sacramental practice**, contrasting with Lutheranism's preservation of Catholic sacramental traditions.  \n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because **consubstantiation** (Lutheran view) and **transubstantiation** (Catholic view) are not directly relevant to the Calvinist-Lutheran contrast.  \n- **Option C** refers to political strategies, which are not the focus of the excerpts.  \n- **Option A** is not supported by the text, as the excerpts do not discuss the relationship between the state and religious institutions.  \n\nThus, **D** is the best answer.",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\nA. De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\nB. Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\nC. Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\nD. De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\nAnswer: ",
        "prediction": "B\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe difference between Columbus's and de las Casas's accounts stems from their distinct perspectives and motivations. Columbus, as an explorer, wrote to justify Spanish actions and portray the indigenous people as eager to trade and convert, which served his own interests and the Spanish crown's agenda. His account reflects a biased, self-serving narrative. In contrast, de las Casas, a later critic, condemned Spanish brutality and exploitation, aiming to highlight the suffering of indigenous peoples. The key difference lies in Columbus's personal bias (Option B), which explains the divergence in their descriptions of Spanish-Native interactions.",
